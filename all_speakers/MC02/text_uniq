THE
THE BOOKS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE
THE BOX CONTAINED THREE SWEATERS
THE DOLPHINS SWAM AROUND OUR BOAT
THE FISH SWAM ACROSS THE POND
THE FOUR BROTHERS LOOKED IDENTICAL
THE HOTEL OWNER SHRUGGED
THE HUMIDITY IS OVERWHELMING THERE
THEIR HOUSE IS GREY AND WHITE
THE ISLANDS ARE SPARSELY POPULATED
THE JOB PROVIDES MANY BENEFITS
THE LITTLE GIRLS CUT LACY VALENTINES
THE LITTLE SCHOOLHOUSE STOOD EMPTY
THE MISGUIDED SOULS HAVE LOST THEIR WAY
THE MUSEUM HIRES MUSICIANS EVERY EVENING
THEN WE'D REALLY HAVE SOMEPLACE TO GO
THE OWNERS REGULARLY LOOK FOR PLUMBING LEAKS
THE PAIR OF SHOES WAS NEW
THE PROSPECT OF CUTTING BACK SPENDING IS AN UNPLEASANT ONE FOR ANY GOVERNOR
THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
THERE IS A TREEHOUSE UP ABOVE
THERE IS DEFINITELY SOME LIGAMENT DAMAGE IN HIS KNEE
THE RESULTS WERE VERY DISAPPOINTING
THERE WAS ONLY ONE DECISION TO BE MADE
THE SUN DIED AT NIGHT
THE TRAIN APPROACHED THE DEPOT SLOWLY
THE WAIT FOR WORK CAN BE VERY LONG
THEY CARRIED ME OFF ON THE STRETCHER
