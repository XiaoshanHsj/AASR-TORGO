M02-Session1-arrayMic-0020 GRANDFATHER LIKES TO BE MODERN IN HIS LANGUAGE
M02-Session1-arrayMic-0023 WELL HE IS NEARLY NINETY-THREE YEARS OLD
M02-Session1-arrayMic-0034 GIVING THOSE WHO OBSERVE HIM A PRONOUNCED FEELING OF THE UTMOST RESPECT
M02-Session1-arrayMic-0035 I CAN
M02-Session1-arrayMic-0036 I CAN READ
M02-Session1-arrayMic-0044 HE DRESSES HIMSELF IN AN ANCIENT BLACK FROCK COAT
M02-Session1-arrayMic-0055 SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR
M02-Session1-arrayMic-0062 WHEN HE SPEAKS HIS VOICE IS JUST A BIT CRACKED AND QUIVERS A TRIFLE
M02-Session1-arrayMic-0066 YET HE STILL THINKS AS SWIFTLY AS EVER
M02-Session1-arrayMic-0067 USUALLY MINUS SEVERAL BUTTONS
M02-Session1-arrayMic-0071 WE HAVE OFTEN URGED HIM TO WALK MORE AND SMOKE LESS
M02-Session1-arrayMic-0080 HE SLOWLY TAKES A SHORT WALK IN THE OPEN AIR EACH DAY
M02-Session1-arrayMic-0092 TWICE EACH DAY HE PLAYS SKILLFULLY AND WITH ZEST UPON OUR SMALL ORGAN
M02-Session1-arrayMic-0098 A LONG FLOWING BEARD CLINGS TO HIS CHIN

M02-Session1-arrayMic-0197 NOTHING IS AS OFFENSIVE AS IGNORANCE
M02-Session1-arrayMic-0198 NOTHING IS AS OFFENSIVE AS INNOCENCE
M02-Session1-arrayMic-0203 SHE IS THINNER THAN I AM
