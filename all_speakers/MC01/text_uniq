THE BOOKS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE
THE BOX CONTAINED THREE SWEATERS
THE DOLPHINS SWAM AROUND OUR BOAT
THE EASTERN COAST IS A PLACE FOR PURE PLEASURE AND EXCITEMENT
THE FAMILY REQUESTS THAT FLOWERS BE OMITTED
THE FISH SWAM ACROSS THE POND
THE FOUR BROTHERS LOOKED IDENTICAL
THE GOLFING FATHERS RULED IN HIS FAVOR
THE HOTEL OWNER SHRUGGED
THE HUMIDITY IS OVERWHELMING THERE
THEIR HOUSE IS GREY AND WHITE
THE ISLANDS ARE SPARSELY POPULATED
THE JOB ALSO COVERS A NUMBER OF OTHER ITEMS
THE JOB PROVIDES MANY BENEFITS
THE LACK OF HEAT COMPOUNDED THE TENANT'S GRIEVANCES
THE LEGISLATURE MET TO JUDGE THE STATE OF PUBLIC EDUCATION
THE LITTLE GIRLS CUT LACY VALENTINES
THE LITTLE SCHOOLHOUSE STOOD EMPTY
THE MARRIAGE WENT WELL FROM THE START
THE MISGUIDED SOULS HAVE LOST THEIR WAY
THE MUSEUM HIRES MUSICIANS EVERY EVENING
THE NEW HIGHWAY IS STRAIGHT AND EMPTY
THEN WE'D REALLY HAVE SOMEPLACE TO GO
THE OWNERS REGULARLY LOOK FOR PLUMBING LEAKS
THE PAIR OF SHOES WAS NEW
THE PLOT IS LACED WITH MYSTERIOUS INCIDENTS
THE PROSPECT OF CUTTING BACK SPENDING IS AN UNPLEASANT ONE FOR ANY GOVERNOR
THE PROWLER WORE A SKI MASK FOR DISGUISE
THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
THERE IS A TREEHOUSE UP ABOVE
THERE IS DEFINITELY SOME LIGAMENT DAMAGE IN HIS KNEE
THERE IS SUCH A PROGRAM
THE RESULTS WERE VERY DISAPPOINTING
THERE WAS NO CONFIRMATION OF SUCH MASSIVE ASSAULTS FROM INDEPENDENT SOURCES
THERE WAS ONLY ONE DECISION TO BE MADE
THE SINGER'S FINGER HAD A SPLINTER
THE SNOW BLEW INTO LARGE DRIFTS
THE STAFF DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT WORKING DOWN HERE UNDER REAL OBSTACLES
THE STORE SERVES MEALS EVERY DAY
THE STRUCTURES HOUSING THE APARTMENTS ARE OF MASONRY AND FRAME CONSTRUCTION
THE SUN DIED AT NIGHT
THE TRAIN APPROACHED THE DEPOT SLOWLY
THE WAIT FOR WORK CAN BE VERY LONG
THEY CARRIED ME OFF ON THE STRETCHER
THEY'LL NEVER FIT ME AGAIN
THEY MAKE GIN SAWS AND DEAL IN PARTS SUPPLIES AND SOME USED GIN MACHINERY
THEY RECEIVED ALL THE THINGS THEY NEEDED
THEY WILL TAKE A WEDDING TRIP LATER
THEY WILL TAKE A WEDDING TRIP TOGETHER
THIGH

WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT TEAM
WE HAVE OFTEN URGED HIM TO WALK MORE AND SMOKE LESS
WE JUST DIDN'T LOOK GOOD
WE JUST SAT THERE GIGGLING
WE KNEW WE WEREN'T DOING WELL
WE KNOW WE CAN SCORE
WELL HE IS NEARLY NINETY-THREE YEARS OLD
WE MUST BE READY FOR ANY NEEDED SACRIFICE
WE'RE
WE'RE ALL DISAPPOINTED WITH OUR START
WE RODE HORSEBACK TO THE FARM
WE SELECTED PLACES WHERE FAMILIES WILL BE WELCOME
WE SHELLED CLAMS FOR THE CHOWDER
WE TALKED ABOUT THE SITUATION
WE'VE DONE IT IN THE PAST
